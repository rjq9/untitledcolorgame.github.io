    <p>This website is a work in progress, and has not been finished yet. Please check in later. <br />
        Thnank You.</p>
    <p>IMPORTANT: Should it be spelled "color" or "colour?" Which should be used for this website? <br /> 
       As a ""compromise,"" the website will be "color," but the title will be "colour." <br />
        Doesn't that make things so easy? :)</p>
